This bot, allows you to manage more group, and be able to netbanning people who scam.

This bot works in a simple way!
You configure a basic group where you can add administrators, then on that group they can type the /netban person command to be banned with the tests.
It will then forward the banned user's ad on our channel and banning the user in all groups where the bot is inserted with permissions to administer.
Next there will be a forwarding bot that will forward the message.
